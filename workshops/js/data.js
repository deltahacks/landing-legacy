Vision:
A plant maintenance worker is walking through an operating industrial facility. As they move their AR glasses/phone/tablet is continuously identifying the process equipment around them and displaying a general information for that specific equipment such as name and alarm conditions or required maintenance. The worker notices one piece of equipment (i.e. pump) indicating a problem and requests more detailed information such as time to next maintenance, data from IoT sensors (i.e. vibration, temperature), operating instructions, flow curves, etc). The worker reviews the data and decides to submit a maintenance request to resolve the issue.

We are going to use Playmaker Finite-State-Machine and JavaScript or C# code to develop and deploy the game. We will step through certain parts of the game to demonstrate core OOD principles and how the Algorithms work, in real-time, through the Playmaker FSM. In addition, we will interact with the Algorithm, game-objects, and environment and see the effects in real-time.`,

Join us in our workshop where we’ll talk about the fascinating revolution going on in the book industry, our experimental api’s, developer motivation, robot motivation, and how we intertwine personalization at a global scale.`,

A host of technologies are emerging that broadly fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) and are revolutionizing how we design and deliver digital experiences. In this talk, we'll discuss how as AI evolves the conversations we have will give us better opportunities to meet customer needs directly through new connected products that go well beyond smartphones and the AI frameworks currently available within this space.
<br/> <br/>
The second part of the discussion will focus on the traction voice platforms are getting. When we use Voice Interfaces, the interaction is primarily carried out by just speaking and listening. This does not mean that we have to disregard everything we have successfully applied to previous interfaces; we need to adapt our process for the nuances of voice-driven interfaces, including conversational interactions, the lack of a screen and the help we can get from the use of some AI capabilities.  The talk will cover the current ecosystem of voice interfaces and also the trends in each of these platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Microsoft Cortana. We will review some of the self-service APIs and tools that can help us to create new voice-driven capabilities for each platform. And we will use Alexa as main device for live demos and live coding.
